# Scientific Tools

This repository was created after a journey through learning Python and doing a PhD on materials science.
Anything that is found here is completely free to use, change, sell, fork... etc. I hope it is a useful to you, as it was to me.
Feel free to submit any corrections or suggestions. They are welcome and appreciated.

The repository is divided in sections dedicated to specific areas with the following scripts:

 - Spectra:
   - Roughly estimate the band gap from a diffuse reflectance spectrum,
   - (soon) Search PhotoChemCAD database for adequate compounds to comparatvely estimate quantum yields.
 - Diffraction:
   - X-ray diffraction plotter with the possibility of using the Materials Project API to fetch the available patterns as comparison.
 - (soon) Image:
   - Create a plot of the red, green and blue pixel color average values of a sequence of images, captured during the synthesis of materials in an Anton Paar Monowave 400 microwave reactor.
